# Charge-Up-Jump

Please download the unity package and import it into unity.
Go to the roll-a-ball scene and go into the ChargeJump folder that's inside the Mechanic folder and drag the ChargeBarUI Prefab under the GameView's Canvas.
Change the x position for the Prefab to -80 and the y to -100. Feel free to adjust these values according to your preference.
Next, Go to the Player GameObject under GameModel and add the two scripts in the ChargeJump folder.
Lastly, please go to the ground game object under decorations and add a Ground tag to it.
That should be it, please let me know if there are any issues!

# Feel free to test out values that work better for your game!
