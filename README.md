# Charge-Up-Jump

Please download the unity package and import it into unity.
Make sure that the Mechanic folder is under Assets
From there, go to the roll-a-ball scene and go into the ChargeJump folder inside the Mechanic folder and drag the ChargeBarUI Prefab under the Canvas, under GameView
Next, Go to the Player GameObject under GameModel and add the two scripts in the ChargeJump folder
That should be it, please let me know if there are any issues!
